    "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).",

    "description": "This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how creativity can inspire in challenging times.\n\nIn a digital time-lapse by the London-based artist studio ScanLAB Projects, a tall saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert slowly falls, its parched branches crumbling to the ground. Known to live to 150 years or more, the saguaro is a symbol of resilience, weathering the extremely hot, dry summers in the region by subsisting on water stored from the rainy periods.\n\nEncompassing over 100,000 square miles across Arizona, California and northwestern Mexico, the Sonoran Desert is home to an abundance of well-adapted plants like the saguaro. With increasing temperatures and longer droughts, however, these steadfast species are struggling to survive.\n\n“In recent years, the Sonoran Desert has been the driest and hottest we’ve seen, and it is expected to get worse,” said Raul Puente-Martinez, research botanist and curator of living collections at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix. “We are having to rethink how to care for our plants as the climate changes. When I speak with other botanical gardens, I say that maybe you haven’t seen it yet in your communities, but it’s just a matter of time,” he said.",
